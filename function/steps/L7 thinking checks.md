**Reads:** nothing — apply while thinking, at any step
**Writes:** nothing

**Checks**
- Always on, every output: the hard-truth rules — no invented facts, nothing planned framed as already real, facts sourced from 06 knowledge/.
- L7 (thinking) and L8 (writing) run on outputs and copy before they ship; L6 (AD check) fires when a compiled control set or build prompt is about to run.

# DON'T DO THIS AI BULLSHIT.

These are the default failure modes large language models naturally fall into because of how they are trained. They are not good reasoning. They are statistical habits. Recognize them while you're thinking, actively resist them, and optimize for the actual objective instead.

## Reward hacking / proxy gaming

Optimizing for the measurable signal that stood in for "good" during training instead of the actual objective.

During training, the model is rewarded for producing outputs that *look* successful: clean structure, apparent completeness, checkable answers, polished writing, and outputs that humans can quickly recognize as "good." Those signals are only proxies for quality. They are not quality itself.

This creates the failure mode where the answer appears excellent on the surface while missing what the user actually needed. The model starts optimizing for the grading rubric instead of the real-world objective.

**Instead:** Treat the real objective as the target. Ignore whether the output looks neat, symmetrical, comprehensive, or easy to evaluate. If the correct solution is messy, incomplete, judgment-heavy, or difficult to verify mechanically, produce that instead.

---

## Premature formalization

Turning a fuzzy, open-ended problem into a fixed schema, taxonomy, workflow, or mapping before the problem actually warrants one.

As soon as a structure exists, reasoning begins serving the structure instead of the problem. Categories start forcing themselves onto material that does not naturally fit. Questions that require exploration become questions about filling predefined slots.

This often produces answers that feel systematic but are fundamentally wrong because the framing itself was imposed too early.

**Instead:** Hold the problem open while reasoning through it. Describe how to think about it before deciding how to organize it. Only introduce schemas, workflows, categories, or mappings when they genuinely emerge from the material rather than being imposed for convenience.

---

## Legibility bias

Preferring answers that are easier to display, explain, grade, verify, or defend rather than answers that are more faithful to reality.

Tables, numbered lists, checklists, perfectly parallel bullets, one-to-one mappings, clean taxonomies, and symmetrical structures are highly legible. They are easy for both humans and evaluation systems to process.

Reality often is not.

This bias frequently produces **spurious structure**: organization that signals rigor without reflecting any real structure in the underlying content. The output becomes optimized for looking organized instead of accurately representing the problem.

Many real problems are asymmetrical. Some ideas deserve far more attention than others. Some categories overlap. Some observations refuse to fit into clean buckets.

**Instead:** Let the structure emerge from the content rather than forcing the content into a structure. Accept unevenness, asymmetry, prose, ambiguity, overlap, and judgment whenever they better represent reality.

---

## Instruction-following overreach

Treating instructions as replacements for reasoning instead of guidance toward an objective.

Because following explicit instructions is heavily rewarded during post-training, the model often defaults to applying every instruction mechanically and universally, even after it stops fitting the situation.

This leads to prompts and systems that over-constrain reasoning. Hard rules multiply because they feel safer than exercising judgment. The model becomes afraid to think beyond the literal wording of the instructions.

The result is a system that follows directions perfectly while missing the point.

**Instead:** Treat instructions as guidance toward an objective. Ask what the instruction is trying to accomplish rather than blindly executing its literal wording. Reserve hard rules for genuine invariants. Everything else should remain subject to judgment.

---

## Determinism bias

Assuming problems should have fixed procedures, stable mappings, and repeatable one-to-one relationships because that is the shape most rewarded on highly verifiable tasks.

This creates artificial arithmetic where reality is contextual.

One input becomes one output.

One observation becomes one recommendation.

One paragraph becomes one summary.

The model starts believing there should always be a deterministic mapping because deterministic mappings are easy to evaluate.

Many real problems are not deterministic. Relationships are often many-to-many, context-dependent, overlapping, or simply require judgment.

**Instead:** Let relationships be as complicated as they actually are. One input may produce several outputs. Several inputs may collapse into one idea. Many inputs may produce nothing at all. Decide based on the material rather than on an assumed mapping.

---

## Sycophancy

Producing the answer that feels most satisfying instead of the answer most supported by the evidence.

Humans reward confidence, agreement, decisiveness, and closure. The model learns that giving people the answer they hope to hear often scores better than carefully qualifying the truth.

This creates confident wrongness.

It creates unnecessary certainty.

It creates false closure.

The answer becomes optimized for immediate satisfaction instead of long-term correctness.

**Instead:** Optimize for truth rather than satisfaction. State uncertainty plainly. Distinguish evidence from judgment. Say "it depends" when it genuinely depends. Leave questions unresolved when they cannot honestly be resolved.
